2. You may use HTML elements and CSS for better presentation of your proposal. For example, this HTML document is generated by using [proposal_template.md](proposal_template.md) and  [proposal.css](proposal.css) and the following pandoc command   

~~~
pandoc -s -i proposal_template.md -o proposal_template.html --css=proposal.css --metadata pagetitle="proposal
