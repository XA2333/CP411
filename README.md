## Q1 Transformations in CG (description)


### Q1.1 Principle of CG transformations

Copy the question and write your answer here.

a. What are the three basic transformations?
Ans: The three basic transformations are translation, rotation, scaling.

b. What is a composite transformation?
Ans: A sequence of basic transformations one after another.

c. Why Homogeneous coordinate system is used in transformation representation and computing?
Ans: Allowing all transformations (including translation) to be handled consistently by matrix multiplication, simplifies transformation, thus make graphics system more reliable.


### Q1.2 Hand on 2D transformations

Write your solution on paper, and take a photo, save it as a3q2.png to the images folder, and link to it in a3_report.md
