## Introduction  

Remember the iconic DVD video logo bouncing around the dark screen? This nostalgic memory inspires our project: a simple 2D game called *DVD Logo Challenge*. Players control the movement of a moving  DVD logo using arrow keys, with the goal of making it hit the exact corners of the game window to score points. This project revives the thrill of watching the logo bounce perfectly into the corner while introducing interactivity through gameplay. 

## Problem Solving and Algorithms  

### Major Problem  
1. **Collision Detection:** Ensuring accurate detection of the DVD logo hitting the edges and corners of the game window.
2. **Player Control:** Implementing smooth movement of the DVD logo using keyboard inputs while maintaining realistic bouncing physics.

### Solutions  
1. **Collision Detection Algorithm:**  
   - Use boundary checks to detect when the DVD logo reaches the edges of the window.  
   - Implement conditional logic to verify if the logo's coordinates match those of a corner.  
2. **Movement and Gameplay Logic:**  
   - Use an event listener to handle arrow key inputs, updating the logo's position dynamically.  
   - Introduce velocity changes to simulate bouncing mechanics upon hitting an edge.  
3. **Color Transition:**  
   - Change the logo's color on every collision by cycling through predefined color values.  

## Design consideration of our CG project

### a. System design 

**Components and their roles**

- Edges of the Screen: Define boundaries for collision detection and scoring.
- Logo: Represents the moving object, interacting with walls and edges.
- Keyboard Inputs: Allows players to control the logo's moving direction through keyboard in real time.
- Score Tracker: Keeps a real-time record of the user’s score when corners are hit.
- Rendering System: Ensures a smooth visual experience for the player.

**How these components come together**

The logo starts by bouncing off from the corner of the edge of the screen. When the player presses an arrow key, it updates the moving direction of the logo. The collision detection system checks if the logo has hit an edge or corner. The logo bounces and change color, indicate that a collision is detected. The score tracker updates the player's score if the collision happens at a corner. The rendering system continously updates the screen to reflect these changes in real time.

**User Stories**

1. As a player, I want to use keyboard inputs to control the direction of the moving logo so I can aim for the screen corners.
2. As a player, I want the logo bounces off walls at the correct angle.
3. As a player, I want to see the logo changes color when bouncing to visually confirm the collision.
4. As a player, I want to control the logo to hit the corner of the screen to score.
5. As a player, I want the game to render in real time so I can see instant feedback on my action.


### b. The architecture 

We will adopt an **MVC (Model, View, Controller)** design pattern:  

**Model (Game Logic)**, Handles the data and logic:
- Keeps track of the logo’s position, velocity, and color.
- Detects collisions and updates the score when the logo hits a corner.
- Manages the player's score and resets the game state if needed.
  
**View (Rendering)**, manages what the user sees:
- Draws the DVD logo, edges, and score on the screen.
- Updates the visuals dynamically (e.g., changes the logo color after collisions).
  
**Controller (Input)**, handles player input:
- Processes arrow key presses to move the DVD logo.
- Communicates these actions to the Model to update the logo’s position.
